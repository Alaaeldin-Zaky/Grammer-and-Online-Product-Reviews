## Dataset

This dataset consists of a list of over 71,045 reviews from 1,000 different products provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. 
The dataset includes the text and title of the review, the name and manufacturer of the product, reviewer metadata, and more.

## Summary of Findings

It could be concluded that generally people tend to write longer reviews when they are mad or dislike the product they bought so they would be more frustrated and have the motive to write more details about the review. 
This also tends to happen with some categories related to beauty and personal care more than movies and food.
